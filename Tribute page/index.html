                <h3>Early life and education</h3>
                <p>Santiago Ramón y Cajal was born 1 My 1852 in Petilla de Aragón, Navarre, Spain.</p>
                <p>He was an avid painter, artist, and gymnast, but his father neither appreciated nor encouraged these abilities, even though these artistic talents would contribute to his success later in life.</p>
                <p>Over the summer of 1868, his father hoped to interest his son in a medical career, and took him to graveyards to find human remains for anatomical study. Sketching bones was a turning point for him and subsequently, he did pursue studies in medicine.</p>
                <p>Ramón y Cajal attended the medical school of the University of Zaragoza, where his father was an anatomy teacher. He graduated in 1873, aged 21.</p>
                <p> After a competitive examination, he served as a medical officer in the Spanish Army. He took part in an expedition to Cuba in 1874–75</p>

                <h3>Scientific career</h3>
                <p>On his return to Spain, he became an assistant in the School of Anatomy in the Faculty of Medicine at Zaragoza (1875) and then, at his own request, Director of the Zaragoza Museum (1879).</p>
                <p>In 1877 he obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine at Madrid and in 1883 he was appointed Professor of Descriptive and General Anatomy at Valencia. In 1887 he was appointed Professor of Histology and Pathological Anatomy at Barcelona and in 1892 he was appointed to the same Chair at Madrid.
                <p>In 1900-1901 he was appointed Director of the «Instituto Nacional de Higiene» and of the «Investigaciones Biológicas».</p>

                <h3>Discoveries</h3>
                <p>Ramón y Cajal made several major contributions to neuroanatomy. He discovered the axonal growth cone, and demonstrated experimentally that the relationship between nerve cells was not continuous, but contiguous. This provided definitive evidence for what Heinrich Waldeyer coined the term neuron theory as opposed to the reticular theory. This is now widely considered the foundation of modern neuroscience.</p>
                <p>By producing excellent depictions of neural structures and their connectivity and providing detailed descriptions of cell types he discovered a new type of cell, which was subsequently named after him, the interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC).</p>

                <h3>Distinctions</h3>
                <p>Among the distinctions won by Cajal are the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Madrid (1895).</li>
                    <li>Honorary Doctor of Medicine of the Universities of Cambridge (1894) and Würzburg (1896).</li>
                    <li>Member of the Royal Academy of Medicine of Madrid (1897).</li>
                    <li>Member of the Spanish Society of Natural History and of the Academy of Sciences of Lisbon (1897).</li>
                    <li>Doctor of Philosophy of the Clark University (Worcester, U.S.A., 1899).</li>
                    <li>Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906, together with the Italian scientist Camillo Golgi "in recognition of their work on the structure of the nervous system".</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Santiago Ramón y Cajal died in Madrid on October 18, 1934.</p>
